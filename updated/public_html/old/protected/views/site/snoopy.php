                    Hey Fellow viewers
                    <img class="wp-smiley" alt=":D" src="/images/img/emotions/icon_biggrin.gif">
                    ,</p>
                <p>
                    I found this awesome story and i figured it would tie in nicely with my previous
                    blog on Dating over New years.</p>
                <p>
                    So, this is what happens if you read my blogs!</p>
                <p>
                    “Happy New Years!” the crowd shouted. I couldn’t believe here it was New year’s
                    again and I still didn’t have a date, nobody to kiss. Every year I end up single
                    and instead of staying home where it won’t bother me, I end up going to a crazy
                    party filled with nothing but couples kissing and dancing. That was when I spotted
                    her, a woman about my age standing across&nbsp;the room with the same look on her
                    face that I was sure I had; loneliness. I walked over to her and smiled, she looked
                    over at me and looked relieved that someone wanted to speak to her during all of
                    this craziness.</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    &nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    “Happy New Year” I managed to shout to her. She smiled and shouted it back to me,
                    lifting her glass of champagne for a toast. After clinging glasses, she drank the
                    rest of her glass and walked closer to me, leaning in she&nbsp;said to me, “I just
                    wanted a kiss on New Years, would you kiss me?” I smiled, knowing exactly how she
                    felt. I nodded and she leaned in a started to kiss me. I expected the kind of kiss
                    that you give to your mom, but somehow she slightly opened her mouth and I slid
                    my tongue in tasting her champagne while our tongues danced in each other’s mouths.
                    When she finally pulled away from me, her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were
                    sparkling, and that was when I noticed just how beautiful she was.&nbsp;I was just
                    about to ask her for her number when she put down her empty glass and grabbed my
                    hand. She started to walk toward the open door and i followed figuring she wanted
                    to find a quieter spot to talk in. But she surprised me, she walked to a door I
                    had never noticed before and opened it, I looked inside and noticed that it was
                    a large closet filled with jackets. Wondering why she was showing me this closet,
                    she backed into it and pulled me in with her.</p>

                    <img class="size-medium wp-image-62 alignright" title="shutterstock_86028595" alt="" src="/images/img/shutterstock_86028595.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300" width="300" height="300"></p>
                <div>
                    Finding a&nbsp;date for New Year’s Eve&nbsp;is a stress that almost everyone on
                    the dating scene has experienced at one time or another in their life. Many people
                    struggle with finding the right person to take out on what is possibly one of the
                    biggest party nights of the year and often settle for anyone who is free and willing.</div>
                <p>
                    The good news is, that glowing night of champagne and noise makers is still a while
                    off, giving you plenty of time to find just the right person to share this special
                    night with. In order to boost your chances for success, it is important to address
                    some specific points about how you will spend that night and who you would ideally
                    like to spend it with (movie stars and models aside.)</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>&nbsp;Where you’ll be:</strong></p>
                <div>
                    Having a party to attend, or throw, or an event that you know you’ll want to attend
                    ahead of time allows you the opportunity to invite someone to an actual event, rather
                    than just the idea of wanting to go out. This can be extremely useful for New Years
                    singles as it helps to have a goal to shoot for when considering candidates for
                    your romantic life.</div>
                <p>
                    Making as many of your New Years Eve plans ahead of time as possible will also be
                    of great use to you later on. When you do find that special date, the last thing
                    you want is to blow it by forgetting something as trivial as having the right shoes
                    to go with your party clothes. It is also vital that you solidify your plans for
                    the night with your date, leaving anything to chance may just break your heart and
                    leave you spending New Years Eve alone.</p>
                <p>
                    If you haven’t received any party invitations, nor heard about anything special
                    happening locally that night you may want to cast a wider net for New Years Eve
                    events in your area (or at least close enough that you don’t mind the travel time.)
                    Knowing ahead of time where you would like to be will greatly reduce your stress
                    when trying to find a date for the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    Those who are choosing to stay at home for the evening may enjoy the wide range
                    of parties being attended via the internet. Spending New Years online is not only
                    great for the budget, but may prove to be just the right place to meet someone if
                    you haven’t had any luck lately, as millions of people get together to chat during
                    this festive evening.<br>
                    <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>What you’ll wear:</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Most people are living on a rather tight budget these days, so don’t feel obligated
                    to dress in&nbsp;an expensive outfit simply because of the occasion. It is important,
                    however that you do look</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="size-medium wp-image-70 alignleft" title="shutterstock_7519639" alt="" src="/images/img/shutterstock_7519639.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200" width="300" height="200"></p>
                <p>
                    your best, so if you have any good party clothes or can afford a new set this might
                    be the time to try some things on and make a trial run of your outfit.<br>
                    Consider that during the course of the evening you may find yourself participating
                    in the traditional party events. You may be compelled to sing and dance or play
                    some New Years Eve games that may be inhibited by your choice in clothing. Again,
                    knowing ahead of time what may lie in store for you can be a great way to avoid
                    minor dating disasters.</p>
                <p>
                    The holidays will try to add some extra pounds to your waistline so it is also vital
                    that you either plan for the extra weight or fight back when those tempting confections
                    try to tack on some pounds. Restricting your diet may not be the easiest thing around
                    this time of year, but your future romance may have you feeling glad you did.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Who you’ll take:</strong></p>
                <div>
                    By now you have hopefully narrowed down how you’ll be spending the evening, naturally
                    the next step is to know who with. Finding just the right person to spend such a
                    special occasion with isn’t always easy, but rest assured, you have more options
                    than ever before.<br>
                    <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-73" title="shutterstock_90194722" alt="" src="/images/img/shutterstock_90194722.jpg?w=300&amp;h=231" width="300" height="231">When heading out to meet new people you already have
                    the most wonderful invitation to offer should you find someone who seems right for
                    you, this is a nice perk to have when dating. Offering an invitation to a New Years
                    bash is a great way to add a little depth to your new relationship, even if you’re
                    only looking for something casual.If the clubs are offering up no real prospects
                    it might be time to make use of the digital age in your search.&nbsp; During this
                    season, thousands of people join online dating communities in the hope that they
                    will find the right person to spend this and perhaps many other New Year’s evening
                    with. Making good use of the dating services offered by so many of the top ranked
                    sites may have you meeting just the right person in no time.Searching through online
                    dating personals and profiles can also help to speed up your search and help you
                    to meet local singles who you might have otherwise&nbsp;never have had the chance
                    to know.&nbsp; Many sites allow you to browse for free before you commit to anything
                    and this may give you an idea of what possibilities this method can offer. Once
                    you meet and feel comfortable with your new romantic interest, you can offer up
                    your invite and welcome in the New Year together.<p>

                            <strong>Why you’ll be happy you did:</strong>Whether you find your romance at the
                            local pub or an online dating chat room, it is important that you take the time
                            to make the night a special one. By planning ahead and finding just the right person
                            you may be heading for one of the best nights of your life.As always, it is important
                            to remember to be safe on this wild party night. It should be a priority not only
                            to watch your alcohol intake, but to arrange for your transportation before you
                            begin the party.&nbsp; Practicing commonsense,&nbsp;dating safety tips&nbsp;is also
                            recommended as some people are apt to do rather crazy things during this night.<p>

                            <strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" class="Apple-style-span">Your first email
                                &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-20 alignnone" title="c-schmitz-closed-envelope-clip-art" alt="" src="/images/img/c-schmitz-closed-envelope-clip-art.jpg?w=54&amp;h=35" width="54" height="35"></a></p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Your first email to someone you’re interested in is the most important one you’ll
                        ever write because it will help determine whether or not they write back. I cannot
                        stress enough how “hey your hot, i want your pussy” is not going to get you laid.
                        It’s important to personalize your introductory email and spend more time asking
                        questions (based on the other person’s profile) than providing information about
                        yourself. Throwing a compliment in doesn’t hurt either (i.e. “I love your smile”
                        or “your profile is one of the best I’ve read”).</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Your first date

                    <p>
                        Your actual date is going to shape the other person’s opinion more than anything
                        else to date. Thus it’s important that you make a great first impression. As the
                        saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a great first impression. Be
                        confident on your date. Confidence is one of the biggest attractions you can posses,
                        don’t over do it though
