                    When a member sends you a note, it goes straight into your onsite message Inbox.
                    We then send an email to your personal email address to let you know that it's there.
                    To read the note, simply login to the site and go to your Inbox. If you decide to
                    write back, simply click "reply", write your own note and send away. Your note will
                    go straight into the member's onsite Inbox, and we'll let them know it's there with
                    an email to their personal email address. All communications with other members
                    stay onsite so that you never have to give out any personal information until you
                    feel completely ready. Then when you are, you can exchange phone numbers and even
                    meet in person.

                    your changes at the bottom of the screen when you're done. Try to put your best
                    foot forward with at least one photo and snappy, detailed essays about your interests.
                    The photo is key since most people feel more comfortable writing to members they
                    can see. Try to stay positive in your essays and let the real you shine.
