            <p>
                It does take time to build a profile of members you regularly interact with who
                you can choose to hookup with. Some lucky members report hooking up night 1, if
                they have the right members nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expect to be getting firm replies from 1 or 2 members for every 25 who you message.
                Remember to make an impact your messages, don't expect the other member to always
                be interested in you and to reply to every message every day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most hook-ups happen after chatting for some time, but we advise to spread yourself
                thin, try to keep regular interaction up with many members so you don't rely on
                one particular member.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might find it takes up to 10 weeks before you have steady relationships with
                members online.
            </p>
            <p>
                So don't get disheartened keep up your game, messaging and winking at suitable members
                and try to think every message through as sometimes you only get 1 shot with some
                members.
            </p>
